                <h1 className="about-h1">About Me</h1>
                <p className="about-h2">Academically<br/></p>
                <p className="about-p">I was first introduced to computer science in middle school, but my interest was
                    piqued in high school, where I explored Python, Java, and basic web development. Those early
                    experiences introduced me to the logic, structure, and creativity of programming and confirmed that
                    this was a field I wanted to pursue at a deeper level.In college, my skills broadened as I moved from introductory work in Python and
                    C++ to using C, Java, JavaScript, and SQL in more advanced settings. Studying data structures and
                    algorithms helped me understand how efficiency and structure shape the quality of a solution.
                    Systems programming and computer organization pushed me to think about how software interacts with
                    hardware and why certain design choices matter. Programming language concepts helped me see how
                    syntax and semantics influence problem-solving across different languages. With that foundation, I
                    approached software engineering, database development, HCI, and machine learning with a stronger
                    understanding of how the entire computing stack fits together. These experiences ultimately shaped me
                    into a developer who approaches new challenges with clarity, adaptability, and intent.</p>
                <p className="about-p">I began studying Spanish in high school, where I was incredibly inspired and
                    eager to continue learning. My family invested in weekly spanish tutoring for me (still going to
                    this day) and workbooks, where I conjugated verbs for fun. Choosing a minor at UF was easy! I
                    enrolled in Spanish courses as soon as I could, starting at the intermediate level. Easily, my
                    favorite course has been an intensive conversational class that pushed me to articulate complex
                    ideas and speak more confidently. From there, I advanced into grammar/composition-focused coursework.
                    I had the opportunity to study abroad in Spain, where I continued refining my language skills through
                    more grammar and cultural study, taught entirely in Spanish. Although I still don&apos;t understand
                    every native speaker&apos;s accent and haven&apos;t learned the whole spanish dictionary, I often
                    surprise people with my level of proficiency and I am forever determined to reach full spanish
                    fluency, even beyond classes at UF. </p>
                <p className="about-h2">Professionally<br/></p>
                <p className="about-p">I&apos;m passionate about building user-friendly applications that solve real-world
                    problems. I enjoy working in teams and learning from other+9*s, as I believe that collaboration is key to
                    success in the tech industry. I&apos;m also interested in product management, as I want to understand
                    how to create products that meet user needs and drive business growth.</p>
                <p className="about-h2">Personally<br/></p>
                <p className="about-p">Before finding my path professionally, I found my life hobby. I&apos;ve been dancing
                    since I was four years old, and I don&apos;t plan on stopping anytime soon. Dance has taught me discipline,
                    perseverance, and the importance of hard work. It&apos;s also a great way to express myself and connect
                    with others. Beyond dance, I&apos;ve developed a love for cooking, which allows me to explore different
                    cultures and flavors. I also enjoy practicing Spanish outside of the classroom, whether through
                    conversation with native speakers or consuming Spanish media. Lastly, I&apos;ve recently picked up bracelet-making
                    as a creative outlet, which has been a fun way to unwind and make personalized gifts for friends
                    and family.
